            <p>Privacy and security are also integral components of online well-being. Protecting our personal information, online identity, and digital assets is crucial. Online privacy involves being cautious about the information we share online, using strong and unique passwords, and being mindful of privacy settings on social media platforms. Security measures such as antivirus software, encryption, and two-factor authentication help safeguard our data from cyber threats. Prioritizing privacy and security in our online activities ensures that we have control over our personal information and reduces the risk of identity theft, data breaches, or other online harms.</p>
